This program checks the implementation of the EOFA force terms.
If we pick a random, small su(3)-valued perturbation dT, and
perturb the gauge field U as
	U' <-- exp(dT)*U
then the change in the action is given, at first order in dT,
by the pseudofermion force, i.e.
	S(U') = S(U) + ReTr(dT*dS/dU) + O(dT^2).
If the perturbation and lattice volume are both small one should
see agreement between
	S(U') - S(U),
which we can compute directly from the Hamiltonian,
and 
	ReTr(dT*dS/dU)
which is computed using the pseudofermion force routines.
Numerically this is tricky since S(U) is an extensive quantity
in which we are trying to compute a small change; this should
work at least to a few digits of accuracy for appropriate (small)
choices of the lattice volume (e.g. 16^3*32) and \delta parameter
(e.g. 1.0e-06).
