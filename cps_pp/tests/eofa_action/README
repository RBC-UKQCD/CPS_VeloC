The test program here is intended to check that the EOFA Hamiltonian is implemented correctly 
by verifying that we can compute the same reweighting factor using both the RHMC and EOFA actions
for a given gauge field configuration.
For Shamir DWF the two actions compute exactly the same determinant; for Mobius DWF they differ
by a factor of
	Z = ( (c+d)^Ls + m1*(c-d)^Ls )^(12*V) / ( (c+d)^Ls + m2*(c-d)^Ls )^(12*V)
where c = 0.5*mobius_scale, d = 0.5, V = L^3*T (4D lattice volume), and m1 and m2 are the numerator
and denominator masses, respectively (see my write-ups for a derivation of this). 
For G-parity Mobius DWF the factor is Z^2 rather than Z due to the fermion doubling.
