This program tests the accuracy of a given EOFA heatbath setup.
Since the EOFA action has the form
	S = \phi^\dag M \phi
we seed the initial fermion field \phi at the start of an HMC
trajectory by generating a Gaussian noise vector \eta and
computing
	|\phi> = M^{-1/2} |\eta>
using a rational approximation to the inverse square root.
In infinite precision arithmetic we should have
	<\eta|\eta> = <\phi|M|\phi>,
but in practice the accuracy is limited by the number of
poles in the rational approximation to x^{-1/2} and the
CG stopping conditions. This program prints <\eta|\eta>
at the start, performs the heatbath calculation 
	|\phi> <-- M^{-1/2} |\eta>
and then computes the Hamiltonian
	H = <\phi|M|\phi>.
One can then check that the relative error
	| <\eta|\eta> - <\phi|M|\phi> | / <\eta|\eta>
is within the desired accuracy.
